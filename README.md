## The Math Quiz Game

This project was created using React, SASS, and TypeScript

### Project Goals
  - To come up with a project idea on my own
  - Create something relatively unique
  - Create an educational game
  - Use TypeScript 

### Project Information

This project is my first game-like application where the goal is to answer math questions. The questions would be simply match equations based on the category selected.
The categories are: Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

### Project Considerations
  - I needed to ensure the multiple choice answer changed randomly so there would be no pattern
  - Keeping questions with a reasonable level (not being too easy or too hard)
  - Making good division questions without decimal answers

### Lessons Learned

The biggest and most important lesson I learned from doing this project is to spend more time thinking about the overall solution and project architecture. I rushed into coding the project without taking a step back and looking at the big picture. 

I learned it's better to spend time thinking of what I really want to accomplish with the project/code and later coding my ideas out. Doing this would have saved time
and effort in the long run as it's hard to maintain/change code that is all over the place.

I also learned having really long files with a bunch of lines of code is difficult to read and maintain. I now ask myself if there is a good reason why a file needs
more than 100 lines of code (specifically in small personal projects).

I struggled a bit with typscript as well as it was new to me and I didn't really understand what it was helping me with at the time.

Overall, looking back at this project (after a couple months of continuous learning) I see MANY ways this project could be updated/changed/improved but I do want to keep it as a reminder of the progress I have made.
